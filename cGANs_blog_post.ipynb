        "# Reproduction and research into Image-to-Image translation using cGANs\n",
        "In this notebook we adopt the code from [Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park and  Tongzhou Wang](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) to reproduce the results from Table 1 in [Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07004). This paper was published in the 2017 CVPR conference and has amassed an impressive 2311 number of citations to this day. The Pytorch implementation was modified for reproduction purposes and can be found [here](https://). Since this is a relatively new direction in image-to-image translation, it is under excessive research. To this end, we also performed an exploration on the hyperparameters in search of improvement in results. Finally, we implemented an experiment of our own using this [dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/facesketch.html) to translate human faces to sketches and reversely in order to demonstrate the power of conditional GANs.\n",

        "Generative Adversarial Networks answer the question \"Having a (large) dataset of examples coming from one distribution, could we construct more examples that belong to the same distribution?\" with an emphatic \"yes\". Of course, the results to date are not perfect and are subject to limitations, but they are certainly promising enough to justify continuous investigation.\n",
        "\n",
        "How do GANs work though? They have their roots in game theory, where we train two adversarial networks to compete with each other, the Generator and the Discriminator. Say, for instance, that we have a dataset of cat pictures and we want to create more pictures with cats. The purpose of the Generator is to generate these brand new pictures with cats, in a way that they look real (how to define real is another complex matter that will be discussed further below). How do we ensure though, that the Generator is indeed trained to generate pictures that look real and not like sketches of cats, for example? This is precisely the job of the Discriminator, to be able to distinguish the real images from the fake (new) images. As the game (training) plays on, both networks learn to do a better job. Consequently, at one point the Generator should be able to create such realistic images, that the Discriminator would have a hard time to distinguish them from real ones (ideally, 50% chance).\n",

All that is left is to combine the objective of the Generator and the Discriminator in a single loss function, so that the two networks do compete with each other. The formula is $$L_{GAN} = E_{x\\sim p_{data}}[logD_{\\theta_D}(x)] + E_{x\\sim p(z)}[log(1-D_{\\theta_D}(G_{\\theta_G}(z)))].$$ Can you guess what each network is trying to achieve? The Disciminator $D_{\\theta_D}$ aims to maximize the loss so that $D_{\\theta_D}(x)$ is close to 1 for real data and $D_{\\theta_D}(G_{\\theta_G}(x))$ is 0 for fake. On the other hand, the Generator $G_{\\theta_G}$ aims to minimize the loss so that $D_{\\theta_D}(G_{\\theta_G}(x))$ is close to 1 (essentially fooling the Discriminator). This can be synopsized as $$arg\\,\\underset{\\theta_G}{min}\\,\\underset{\\theta_D}{max}\\,L_{GAN}.$$ This last equation is the essence of GANs."

        "## From GANs to Conditional GANs\n",
        "Now, let us change a little bit the settings of the initial problem. Let's instead say that we want to translate the images of a distribution to images of a different distribution, _conditioned_ on the first distribution. For example, we may want to translate a satellite image into a map image (similar to Google maps). This is more of a traditional supervised learning problem, as we can have pairs of images _x_ and _y_, for which we want our Generator network to take as input the image _x_ (and noise _z_) and output _y_, $G: (x, z) \\rightarrow y$. \n",

Efros) put together different pieces of the latest research and discover a conditional GAN (cGAN) which provides impressive results to the image-to-image translation problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "The objective function for cGANs is different from that in GANs due to the conditioning of the input. The Generator does not just take noise and output an image, but also takes as input the image to be translated. In addition to that, the authors discover that conditioning the input in the Discriminator (in a sense that the Discriminator takes as input both the image _x_ and the output image _y_) yielded better results. As a result, the final loss function of the cGAN can be expressed as: $$L_{cGAN} = E_{x, y}[logD_{\\theta_D}(x, y)] + E_{x, z}[log(1-D_{\\theta_D}(x, G_{\\theta_G}(x, z)))].$$ In addition to that, an L1 term loss was also found to be beneficial when added to the cGAN loss. The final objective is then $$G* = arg\\,\\underset{G}{min}\\,\\underset{D}{max}\\,L_{cGAN}(G, D) + \\lambda L_{L1}(G).$$\n",

Any human would say that the L1+cGAN generated image is more than 5 times more realistic than the L1 image. However, the FCN scores show that the difference of quality is almost insignificant.

        "\n",
        " A new dataset was downloaded from http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/archive/facesketch.html. This dataset includes 188 faces from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) student database. For each face, there is a sketch drawn by an artist based on a photo taken in a frontal pose, under normal lighting condition, and with a neutral expression.\n",
        "\n",
        " The goal of this dataset is to train a cGAN that can create sketches from face images and the other way around. Two different types of cGANs were used and compared to each other, pix2pix and cycleGAN. In pix2pix the images have to be in pairs, so that the network can learn a mapping from one of these to the other (one way mapping). Sometimes we only have two sets of images that are not paired (think of faces and sketches where the sketches belong to different faces). In that case, cycleGAN can be used with great success. Its inputs are unpaired images from two different domains that the network will learn to translate (in both directions). CycleGANs do not need to have tightly correlated images combined in one picture. It is a more general way to translate images and this is the reason why sometimes they give better results. Another difference between these two types of cGANs is that in cycleGAN's objective function there is an extra criterion, the cycle consistency loss that helps to achieve the translation. Moreover, cycleGAN consists of four networks (two discriminators and two generators) while pix2pix consists of only two (one discriminator, one generator). \n",
        "\n",
        " In order for both of these types to work properly, images of both faces and sketches had to be resized to 414*512. This was implemented with a script ('massive_resizer' below). Moreover, for pix2pix the face and its corresponding sketch needed to be in the same image, as described above. This was done by combining them horizontally, once again, with a script ('pix2pix_combine') which has a similar format as an existing one ('combine_A_and_B') in the original paper. For cycleGAN the training set was chosen to contain 178 images and 10 for testing whereas for pix2pix we ran the experiment with a training set of 170 images, a validation set of 8 images and a testing set of 10 images.\n",
        "\n",
        "  For cycleGAN, even though it was trained only on people's faces from Asia, it can generalize well into any face image (it gives even better results if there is constant background). Below some pictures from celebrities and their sketches are presented. <br>\n",
